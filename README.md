## Project Overview
This project was conducted for a client who is researching the use of bacteria in sythesizing proteins that taste like beef. The client hypothesizes that the ideal bacterial species to make synthetic beef may be found in the belly button, and has sampled the navels of individuals across the country in order to identify the different species that colonize belly buttons. A dashboard was created that is intended to be used by both the researchers and the research participants of the project.

The dashboard allows the participants and the researchers to view data on the bacteria that reside in each particpant's navel as well as the frequency of the particiant's navel washing. This is done by selecting the participant's ID number from the dropdown menu. 

**Deliverable 1**:  
- Collects bacteria data for the participant ID that is selected from the dropdown menu.   
- Selects the top 10 bacteria species for that participant ID.   
- Displays this data in a hortizontal bar chart in descending order from top to bottom.      

**Deliverable 2**: 
- Displays the bacteria data for the selected participant in a bubble chart. The bacteria ID numbers are used on the x-axis, and the sample values are used on the y-axis and as a reference for the size of each bubble.        

**Deliverable 3**: 
- Collects navel washing data for the participant ID that is selected. 
- Displays the frequency of belly button washing for the selected participant in a gauge chart.   

**Deliverable 4**: 
- Background colors were changed. 
- Backgrounds of the charts were changed to be transparent.
- A custom font was added. 
- A button was added that takes the user to the github repository for the project.
